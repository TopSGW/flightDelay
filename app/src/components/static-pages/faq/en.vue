    <li>How can Boarding Claims help me?</li>
    <p>
      Air passengers travelling to or from a European airport and facing delays of 2 hours or more, cancellation or
      rebooking are entitled to a monetary compensation according to their situation, in accordance with EU Regulation
      261/2004. These fees range from €250 to €600 per passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boarding Claims specializes in submitting compensation claims to the liable airlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our team of solicitors and lawyers and our extensive network will handle damage claims from A to Z. Our service
      also includes the legal steps that can be taken in case the submitted claims are rejected or declared inadmissible
      by the airline, and this free of charge.
    </p>

    <li>Which flights are eligible for compensation?</li>
    <p>
      First of all, there is a geographic condition. It concerns flights from or within the European Union (including
      the French overseas territories) and the non-member states who have converted or adopted the EU Regulation:
      Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey and Morocco. Flights from third countries to the European Union, Iceland,
      Norway, Switzerland, Turkey or Morocco have the additional condition that they must be carried out by airlines who
      have their registered office in one of the abovementioned countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case of a delay the flight is eligible for compensation if the delay was at least 2 hours regarding flight
      distances less than 1500 km, at least 3 hours regarding flight distances between 1500 km and 3500 km, and at least
      4 hours regarding flight distances more than 3500 km (except the flights within the European Union).
    </p>
    <p>
      In case of a change of flight by the airline, you must regard the initially booked flight as a cancelled flight if
      the airline has notified you.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can file a claim for compensation for a cancelled flight depending on the impact of the changed flight hours
      and the time lag between the moment when the airline notified you of the modified flight hours and the new time of
      departure or arrival:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the airline has notified you of the modified flight hours less than 7 days before departure, and the new
        flight hours imply that you must leave 1 hour earlier compared to the initial flight hours, or that you reach
        the final destination less than 2 hours later compared to the initially scheduled arrival time.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the airline has notified you of the modified flight hours less than 14 days before departure, and the new
        flight hours imply that you must leave 2 hours earlier compared to the initial flight hours, or that you reach
        the final destination less than 4 hours later compared to the initially scheduled arrival time.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <li>What does no cure, no pay mean?</li>
    <p>
      Boarding Claims works on the basis of the customer-friendly principle of no cure, no pay. This means that
      authorizing Boarding Claims to act on your behalf is completely free of charge when the airline has a legitimate
      reason for not paying a compensation, even if Boarding Claims itself has made costs while handling the damage
      file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon successful processing of your claim Boarding Claims will be entitled to a handling fee equal to 25% (VAT
      included) of the amount of damages. The whole procedure therefore comes at no costs, because the only 'cost' is a
      reduced compensation.
    </p>

    <li>How long does it take?</li>
    <p>
      Boarding Claims is committed to handling your claim as short as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The procedure of a damage request, from the introduction to the final payment or final rejection, may vary from a
      few weeks to two years. In case of a judicial procedure or if legal complications occur you have to take a waiting
      period of two years into account.
    </p>
    <p>
      In principle we aim to handle a claim within 6 months.
    </p>

    <li>Can I cancel an ongoing procedure?</li>
    <p>
      Of course, you are free to terminate the procedure at any time. If the airline nevertheless pays a compensation
      after cessation of the procedure, but because of the actions undertaken by Boarding Claims, we deposit the amount
      to you after deducting the handling fee.
    </p>

    <li>Can I file a claim against the airline?</li>
    <p>
      Of course, every passenger is free to file a claim against an airline.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have to take possible opposition by airlines into account, as well as cumbersome bureaucratic procedures and
      long waiting times. In the case of legal complications or judicial proceedings you also have to expect further
      costs.
    </p>

    <li>What should I do if the airline approaches me directly?</li>
    <p>
      In case the airline approaches you directly even though you authorized us to act on your behalf, it is important
      that you notify us as soon as possible to avoid further steps, such as legal proceedings, are being unnecessarily
      taken. You can simply notify us with an email to <a
      href="mailto:info@boardingclaims.com">info@boardingclaims.com</a>.
    </p>

    <li>Can I follow up the status of my claim?</li>
    <p>
      Boarding Claims will keep you informed of the progress of your claim at every new step or each new reaction from
      the airline. You can also contact us at any time by emailing us to <a href="mailto:info@boardingclaims.com">info@boardingclaims.com</a>.
    </p>

    <li>Why do I receive letters from the court?</li>
    <p>
      If we have started legal proceedings against an airline you will possibly receive letters on your residential
      address containing communications or notices of dates on which we have to be present in court for the treatment of
      the claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may at all times assume that our lawyers have received the same letters and will represent you in court. Your
      presence in court is thus not required.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you nevertheless do have the intention to be present at court sessions, we kindly ask you to inform us in
      advance so we can bring you in contact with the lawyer. By aligning with the lawyer you can avoid unnecessarily
      long waiting times in court.
    </p>

    <li>How much time do I have to submit an application?</li>
    <p>
      The limitation period is different in every European country. In Belgium it amounts to one year, but in other
      countries such as France or the Netherlands it amounts to two years, which means that a legal process must have
      been initiated within that period.
    </p>

    <li>Will Boarding Claims go for every case to the court?</li>
    <p>
      No, only if Boarding Claims believes that the answer of the airline is not acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the airline invokes a legitimate reason to refuse the compensation, such as a volcanic eruption, wildcat
      strike actions, political upheaval or any other exceptional situation, Boarding Claims will accept the refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, Boarding Claims cannot be held by the customer to initiate legal proceedings. This remains at
      all times the decision of Boarding Claims itself, based on its own estimates.
