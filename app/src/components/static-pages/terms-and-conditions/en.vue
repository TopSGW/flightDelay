            client’s omission to read his or her e-mails on a regular basis.

            The client empowers and/or authorizes Boarding Claims to collect the claim in an extrajudicial process, and
            shall comply with any instructions deemed useful by Boarding Claims in order to collect the claim. The

            It is at the sole discretion of Boarding Claims whether to start up an amicable process in order to collect
